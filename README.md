# MatchGame
This file contains my Match Game for Udacity final project.
This game contains a deck of 16 cards that are shuffled upon the game beginning.  The player then tries to match two cards.
If two cards don't match, the game will turn red, animate a "shake" and turn the cards back over.  If the cards match, the cards should bounce, turn green and stay exposed.  The game board contains a timer so the player can see time as they play, a score panel that
provides a "star rating" as they play, and a "restart" button should they want to start the game over.
Once all 16 cards have been matched, a modal popup window  will be exposed.  The popup provides a congratulatory message which includes:  
total elapsed time to play the game, a star rating that is based on the number of attempts used in the game, and the total number of attempts used during the game, and a button that allows the player to continue to another game.
