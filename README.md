# MatchGame
This file contains my Match Game for Udacity final project.
This game contains a deck of 16 cards that are shuffled upon the game beginning.  The player then tries to match two cards.
If two cards don't match, the game will turn red, animate a "shake" and turn the cards back over.  If the cards match, the cards should bounce, turn green and stay exposed.  The game board contains a timer so the player can see time as they play, a score panel that
provides a "star rating" as they play, and a "restart" button should they want to start the game over.
Once all 16 cards have been matched, a modal popup window  will be exposed.  The popup provides a congratulatory message which includes:  
total elapsed time to play the game, a star rating that is based on the number of attempts used in the game, and the total number of attempts used during the game, and a button that allows the player to continue to another game.

Dependencies:  the game must have access to the following files:
    1.  https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css
    2.  https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda
    3.  https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js
    
 To play the game, download the three files: app.js, index.html, and app.css.  These files may be zipped or downloaded as is but they should all reside in the same directory when playing is attempted.
